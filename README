This is the perl5 IO::Handle distribution.

The majority of this code was extracted from FileHandle, but has now been
split into a hierarchy of packages.

The documentation is a little thin, it currently stands as the FileHandle
docs split out. More could be done, if people decide this is the way to
go then I will do more.

There is a patch included which will patch perl to make all IO objects
blessed into IO::Handle instead of FileHandle
