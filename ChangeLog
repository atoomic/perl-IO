Release 1.12 -- Thu 19 Sep 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO.xs so that it will compile with pre perlio version
	  of perl (ie pre perl5.003_02)

	  if the socket is connected

	  on a partly initialised connection
	o Changed IO.xs to use Perlio
	o Modified usage message to report correct package
	o Added IO::File::new changes from Chip, to allow PERM to be passed
	o Added sysread and syswrite methods to IO::Handle
	o Updated documentation

	  was removed.

Thu 25 Jul 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o It is now not necessary to call the domain sub-classes of
	  IO::Socket. when connect is called it notes the domain.
	  Domain specific methods, which are normally non-critical, are
	  called via this note-ing.
	o Added methods to IO::Socket to retrieve the domain, type and
	  protocol of a given socket

Tue 23 Jul 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o IO::Socket::connect changed how we do timeouts, as it did not work

	o IO::Handle::new_from_fd removed method call to _ref_fd, which was
	  a leftover from FileHandle

Fri 28 Jun 1996 <bodg@tiuk.ti.com> Graham Barr

	o Modified IO::Socket::UNIX::configure to default to using a socket
	  type of SOCK_STREAM if no type is specified.
